# vidai

A simple project vibe-coded using AI studio build mode. Currently you can upload a video and talk to the model using it. Planning to add more features like 

* x-ray mode where the model can add analysis about a segment of the video and overlays on the screen 
* Model output segments linked to the video, so that you can easily refer to the section that the model is talking about
